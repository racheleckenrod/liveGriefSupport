A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. Its demo images* are courtesy of the supremely
talented photographer Felicia Simion. If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by
awesome stuff, check out her portfolio for more stunning images:

To continue my documentation, I just found and deleted a package-lock.jason file 
from my desktop- doesn't seem like it belongs there. glad to have it removed. just had
 a successful post to the database from my current local host, and updated the .gitignore 
 to include the DS_Store files.. whatever they are


 Just noticed that me .md README is missing from the bridge here, so I'm going to remove this txt README here.
