incoming comment from the "final" branch, designed to re-attach the main HEAD

Oh dear I dont have my README, but here is the txt file... going to have to visit the olive branch.

I didn't realize I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had done an old fashioned copy/paste of that README I just made... (all by myself with a new file and everything..)

in the meantime, Ill put down in here what I left in the last txt README, just for good measure..


here it is_

To explain it in other words, every time you update your website (on heroku, anyway, and this was for free which is ending in a month)...

it keeps what you just did .

like taking the most recent work and removing it from you. leaving you without a HEAD. 

so, if you don't know that that is what is happening, you can't make something nice for heroku. this is why my best code was at heroku and not in my computer. They dont take a picture of your painting, they keep your painting. So you need to make them something that you don't want back. not show them and  they get a "version" like a copy, but like make them a print of the original so they can have it. It was a lot of work to get my HEADs back... those are commits they take and github doesn't have access to the commits heroku has. So you need to make a whole package to give away. I can't probably explain what it felt like in my body when I got those HEADs back the other day. I have no problem making them a file and giving it to them ... like that other README.md that I just made and they have the ONLY (I think) "copy" of it. the main/master thing 

So, for me now, what I see there is to do... is an old fashioned copy/paste of this text file into another NEW README.md, that eventually will get picked up by git, and want to merge into the other original that I made, essentially leaving me with one. OK?



I put a little more info in the other README in the last commit, but even for me, keeping track of two README files in each branch is a little much, so I'll be making this last comment in the README.txt file and be leaving it behind, moving forward with the .md at least in this project. I can only assume they will be reunited at some point and updated but more likely merged.

-so long-

be right back with some more of my original work so I can make another original README.md file for this, the main branch. see how much trouble deployment is when you also have another repo. I didn't know how to use this global file tracking system so I wasn't like I COULD get anything accomplished.
