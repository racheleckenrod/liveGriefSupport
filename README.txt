A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. Its demo images* are courtesy of the supremely
talented photographer Felicia Simion. If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by
awesome stuff, check out her portfolio for more stunning images:

Imporing the comments I made in the tempBranchh that is being deployed to heroku after I created this branch but before I checked it out:

***
after spending the day yesterday with rebasing etc, I am ready to approad coding differently I created this branch brigde to help me work out the interfacing between the two sites that is only a mvp of the final product that will make much of this unnecessary, but serves me well as a learning experience. for example: the sessions and using the guest route- In the other site I am going to eventually abondon, I need to set up a way to have the user and guest user be able to submit forms or restrict access to the chatrooms or that page alltogether which would orgininate here where they fin the link that points to grief-support, aka the chat. I see right now that the process is still not being respected as all this info belongs on the new branch's readne, and not so much here,

-Today is thursday october 6 2022- 
I imaginge it will prove to be serving the greater good to have called in Brother-Pete first as he has an account through the believe-it-or-not site, as well as the live-grief-support site. In response, he did a screen sharing session with me locally last night. Unfornutately at that time, I was unable to convey to him what I was suspecting I had done. After seeking his counsil, and getting nothing constructive about how to proceed - " "just in case" " this thing I had isolated was as big a deal as I suspected that it was; I did the best that I knew, and went to my already open terminal window but had to look up the correct commands to do a rm -rf of the untracked package-lock.json file that I isolated through a day's work of interactive git rebasing -in an effort to retrieve the detached HEAD of my main branch of (the other site) grief-support - intentionally to keep it out of my code (and everybody else's too, if applicable) that has the programming in it that appears to be mining - or probably some other term that is so-called universally known .... anyway, 

To continue my documentation, I just found and deleted a package-lock.jason file from my desktop- doesn't seem like it belongs there. glad to have it removed. just had a successful post to the database from my current local host, and updated the .gitignore to include the DS_Store files.. whatever they are
