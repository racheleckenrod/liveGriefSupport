after spending the day yesterday with rebasing etc, I am ready to approad coding differently I created this branch brigde to help me work out the interfacing between the two sites that is only a mvp of the final product that will make much of this unnecessary, but serves me well as a learning experience. for example: the sessions and using the guest route- In the other site I am going to eventually abondon, I need to set up a way to have the user and guest user be able to submit forms or restrict access to the chatrooms or that page alltogether which would orgininate here where they fin the link that points to grief-support, aka the chat. I see right now that the process is still not being respected as all this info belongs on the new branch's readne, and not so much here,
