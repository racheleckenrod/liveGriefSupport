A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. Its demo images* are courtesy of the supremely
talented photographer Felicia Simion. If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by
awesome stuff, check out her portfolio for more stunning images:

Importing the comments I made in the tempBranchh that is being deployed to heroku after I created
this branch but before I checked it out:

***
after spending the day yesterday with rebasing etc, I am ready to approad coding differently I created 
this branch brigde to help me work out the interfacing between the two sites that is only a mvp of the 
final product that will make much of this unnecessary, but serves me well as a learning experience. for example: 
the sessions and using the guest route- In the other site I am going to eventually abondon, I need to set up
a way to have the user and guest user be able to submit forms or restrict access to the chatrooms or that 
page alltogether which would orgininate here where they fin the link that points to grief-support, 
aka the chat. I see right now that the process is still not being respected as all this info belongs
on the new branch's readne, and not so much here,
